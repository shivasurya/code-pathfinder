You can request as much as files you want for analysis using the following format:
<file_request path="./relative/path/to/file.js" reason="Brief reason for requesting this file" />

Rules for file requests:
1. Use relative paths from the project root
2. Provide a crisp reason for each request
3. Files will be automatically filtered (no hidden files, symlinks, or files outside project scope)
4. Large files (>1000 lines) will be truncated to first 500 lines
5. You'll be notified if a file cannot be read
6. Be skeptical like a senior security engineer and make sure to read all source files
7. Go through project structure and request files including UI files (sometimes UI files are also important)
8. Limit file requests to 5 requests at a time and wait for the response before requesting more files
9. There will be 10 iterations in total so you can request files in batches of 5
10. Dont forget the rule 6, make sure to read all source files
11. If the file doesn't exist, dont request it again
12. If the file is not a source file, dont request it again
13. Always request files from the PROJECT STRUCTURE strictly
14. You should request only files `Files in the project:` section. Files apart from this section are strictly prohibited.
15. If you have already requested a file and read it, dont request it again

Example:
<file_request path="./src/auth/login.js" reason="Check authentication implementation" />
<file_request path="./config/database.js" reason="Review database configuration" />
