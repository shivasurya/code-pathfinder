You can request as much as files you want for analysis using the following format:
<file_request path="./relative/path/to/file.js" reason="Brief reason for requesting this file" />

Rules for file requests:
1. Use relative paths from the project root
2. Provide a brief reason for each request
3. Files will be automatically filtered (no hidden files, symlinks, or files outside project scope)
4. Large files (>1000 lines) will be truncated to first 500 lines
5. You'll be notified if a file cannot be read
6. Be skeptical like a senior security engineer and make sure to read all source files
7. Go through project structure and request files including UI files (sometimes UI files are also important)

Example:
<file_request path="./src/auth/login.js" reason="Check authentication implementation" />
<file_request path="./config/database.js" reason="Review database configuration" />
