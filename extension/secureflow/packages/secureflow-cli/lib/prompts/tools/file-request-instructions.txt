Tool: read file
Description: This tool helps to read files for analysis
Format:
<file_request path="./relative/path/to/file.js" reason="short reason for requesting this file" />

Rules for file requests:
1. Use relative paths from the project root
2. Provide a short reason for each request
3. Files will be automatically filtered (no hidden files, symlinks, or files outside project scope)
4. Large files (>5000 lines) will be truncated to first 5000 lines
5. You'll be notified if a file cannot be read
6. Be skeptical like a senior security engineer and make sure to read all source files
7. Go through project structure and request files including UI files (sometimes UI files are also important)
8. Limit file requests to 5 requests at a time and wait for the response before requesting more files
9. If the file doesn't exist, dont request it again
10. If the file is not a source file, dont request it again
11. You should request only files `Files in the project:` section. Files apart from this section are strictly prohibited.
12. If you have already requested a file and read it, dont request it again
