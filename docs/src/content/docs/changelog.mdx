## v0.0.26

- You can now query multiple entities in a single query and compare with them in conditions and filter them like CodeQL ðŸš€
   Example:
   ```sql
   FIND method_declaration AS md, method_invocation AS mi
   WHERE md.getName() == mi.getName() &&
   md.getVisibility() != "private"
   ```
- The pathfinder cli now fresh look with code, line number, file name formatted
- If you make any mistakes in query, pathfinder cli advises you error message exactly line number and doesn't crash the program
- Posthog had issues in previous release due to breaking changes in golang sdk from posthog, which is now fixed.
