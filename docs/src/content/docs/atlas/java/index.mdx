# Java Rules

Browse our comprehensive collection of Java-specific rules designed to identify vulnerabilities and code quality issues in your Java applications.

## Featured Rules

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SQL Injection" icon="warning">
    **Severity: Critical**  
    Detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in Java applications.
    ```java
    String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userInput + "'";
    Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Insecure Random" icon="warning">
    **Severity: High**  
    Identifies usage of java.util.Random for security-sensitive operations instead of SecureRandom.
    ```java
    Random random = new Random(); // Insecure for cryptographic purposes
    byte[] bytes = new byte[20];
    random.nextBytes(bytes);
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Hardcoded Credentials" icon="warning">
    **Severity: Critical**  
    Detects hardcoded credentials in Java source code.
    ```java
    String password = "hardcoded_password"; // Security risk
    connection.authenticate(username, password);
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Unsafe Deserialization" icon="warning">
    **Severity: High**  
    Identifies unsafe deserialization of untrusted data.
    ```java
    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);
    Object obj = in.readObject(); // Potentially unsafe
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Rule Categories

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Rules for detecting security issues like XSS, CSRF, and more
- **Performance Issues**: Rules for identifying performance bottlenecks
- **Code Quality**: Rules for ensuring code maintainability and readability
- **Best Practices**: Rules for enforcing Java best practices and conventions

## How to Use

To run these rules against your Java codebase:

```bash
code-pathfinder scan --lang java --rules java/security /path/to/your/project
```

For more information on using Code PathFinder with Java, see our [Java documentation](/docs/java).
