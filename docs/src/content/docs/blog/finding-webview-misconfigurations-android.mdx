      ## Introduction

      Android WebView is a component that allows you to display web content in your Android application. It's fairly complex to configure and easy to misconfigure. From browsers to
      third-party applications, they use powerful APIs to interact with the web, such as sending cookies, setting local storage, setting headers, and more.
      In this blog post, we will discuss how to detect WebView misconfigurations in Android with [Code-PathFinder](https://github.com/shivasurya/code-pathfinder).

      ### WebView Misconfigurations

      - Cross-site scripting
      - Enabling content access from WebView JavaScript
      - Enabling file access from WebView JavaScript
      - Enabling universal file access from WebView JavaScript
      - JavaScript settings
      - WebView JavaScript interface injection

      #### Cross-site scripting

      Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web application. This can be used to steal sensitive information,
      such as user credentials, or to take control of the victim's account. WebView poses a couple of methods to execute JavaScript in the context of the WebView, and it doesn't respect the
      same-origin policy. Such methods are:

      - `loadUrl`
      - `loadData`
      - `loadDataWithBaseURL`
      - `evaluateJavascript`
      - `evaluateJavaScriptAsync`

      When using these methods, it's important to ensure that the data being passed in is properly sanitized and validated. Additionally, the application should be aware of the context in which
      the JavaScript code is being used. Code-PathFinder helps you find the code path where the JavaScript is being executed and the data being passed in is not properly sanitized and validated.

      ```sql
      FROM method_invocation AS mi
      WHERE
        mi.GetName() = "loadUrl" || mi.GetName() = "loadData"
        || mi.GetName() = "loadDataWithBaseURL"
        || mi.GetName() = "evaluateJavascript"
        || mi.GetName() = "evaluateJavaScriptAsync"
      SELECT mi, mi.GetEnclosingMethod()
      ```


      #### Enabling Content URL access from WebView

      The content protocol allows loading data from a URL. For instance, content:// is used to load data from a file on the device such as images, videos, etc. While this is a useful feature, it can also be
      misused to access sensitive data from the application's file system. This can be done by using the `setAllowContentAccess` method of the WebView class. Using Code-PathFinder, you can find the code path where the
      `setAllowContentAccess` method is being called.

      ```sql
      FROM method_invocation AS mi
      WHERE
        mi.GetName() = "setAllowContentAccess"
      SELECT mi, mi.GetEnclosingMethod()
      ```

      ### Enabling File access from WebView JavaScript

      The file protocol allows loading data from a file on the device. For instance, file:// is used to load data from a file on the device such as images, videos, etc. While this is a useful feature, it can also be
      misused to access sensitive data from the application's file system. This can be done by using the `setAllowFileAccess` method of the WebView class. Using Code-PathFinder, you can find the code path where the
      `setAllowFileAccess` and `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs` methods are being called.

      ```sql
      FROM method_invocation AS mi
      WHERE
       mi.GetName() = "setAllowFileAccess"
       || mi.GetName() = "setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs"
      SELECT mi, mi.GetEnclosingMethod()
      ```

      ### Enabling Universal file access from WebView JavaScript

      The `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` method allows JavaScript to access the file protocol from any origin. This can be used to access sensitive data from the application's file system. If this WebView setting is enabled,
      the web page can access the file system of the device. While this is a useful feature to flexibly access files and content, it seriously poses a security threat when arbitrary website JavaScript is loaded into the frame.
      Using Code-PathFinder, you can find the code path where the `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` method is being called.

      ```sql
      FROM method_invocation AS mi
      WHERE
        mi.GetName() = "setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs"
      SELECT mi, mi.GetEnclosingMethod()
      ```

      ### JavaScript settings

      JavaScript settings can be used to control the behavior of the WebView. For instance, you can enable or disable JavaScript, enable or disable JavaScript interfaces, enable or disable JavaScript's ability to open windows,
      and enable or disable JavaScript's ability to open popups. Using Code-PathFinder, you can find the code path where the `setJavaScriptEnabled` method is being called.

      ```sql
      FROM method_invocation AS mi
      WHERE
        (mi.GetName() = "setJavaScriptEnabled" && "true" in mi.getArgumentName())
        || (mi.GetName() = "setJavaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically" && "true" in mi.getArgumentName())
      SELECT mi, mi.GetEnclosingMethod()
      ```

      ### JavaScript interfaces

      Here comes the most important ⚠️ and exciting part of the WebView. JavaScript interfaces allow you to expose native methods to JavaScript. For instance, you can expose a native method to JavaScript to open a file picker
      or execute Java methods. Historically, [JavaScript interfaces](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/webview-addjavascriptinterface-remote-code-execution) were abused to execute arbitrary code on the device and
      attain remote code execution. Using Code-PathFinder, you can find the code path where the `addJavascriptInterface` method is being called.

      ```sql
      predicate isJavaScriptEnabled(method_invocation mi) {
        mi.getName() == "addJavascriptInterface"
      }

      FROM method_invocation AS mi
      WHERE isJavaScriptEnabled(mi)
      SELECT mi.getName(), "JavaScript interface exposed"
      ```

      The above vulnerability classification is based on the [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/) and [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/).

      ### Conclusion

      While [Code-PathFinder, the open-source alternative to CodeQL](https://codepathfinder.dev), is a powerful tool for finding security vulnerabilities in Android applications, one can always tweak the queries to filter out false positives
      more effectively compared to grep-based scanners like `ast-grep`. This is because the taint analysis and source-to-sink analysis are far more powerful than grep-based scanners. Give it a try and file an [issue](https://github.com/shivasurya/code-pathfinder/issues)
      if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.
