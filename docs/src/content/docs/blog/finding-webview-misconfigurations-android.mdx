      ## Introduction

      Android WebView is a component that allows you to display web content in your Android application. It's fairly complex to configure and easy to misconfigure. From Browsers to
      Third party applications, they use powerful APIs to interact with the web. Such as, sending cookies, local storage setting headers, and more.
      In this blog post, we will be discussing how to detect webview misconfigurations in Android with [Code-PathFinder](https://github.com/shivasurya/code-pathfinder).
