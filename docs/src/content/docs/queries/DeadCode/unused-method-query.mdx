## Unused Declared Method Query

Pathfinder supports querying for unused declared methods in the source code. The query is designed to identify methods that are declared but not used in the source code or invoked within the project.

## Query Syntax

The query syntax is simple, easy to use and inspired by SQL. The has_access routine is used to check if the method is being accessed across the project.
```sql
/* 
Query to find unused declared methods in the source code
ruleid: unused-declared-method-query
language: java
description: Unused declared methods detected in the source code
category: productivity, maintainability, clean-code
confidence: medium
priority: high
tags: code-smell, unused-method 
false-positives: false positives are possible if there are implemented methods
*/
FIND method_declaration WHERE has_access = false
```
