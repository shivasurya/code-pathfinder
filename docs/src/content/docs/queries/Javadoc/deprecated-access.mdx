## Avoid Deprecated Callable Access Query

Pathfinder supports querying for deprecated callable access in the source code. The query is designed to identify deprecated callable access in the source code.

## Query Syntax

The query syntax is simple, easy to use and inspired by SQL.

```sql
FROM method_declaration AS md
WHERE "@Deprecated" in md.getAnnotation()
SELECT md, "Listing all deprecated methods"
```
