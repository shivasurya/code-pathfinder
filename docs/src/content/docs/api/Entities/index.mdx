# Query structure

The query structure is simple, easy to use and inspired by SQL. Query often start with the keyword `FIND` followed by the entity type and then the condition.

```sql
FROM entity_type AS entity_variable WHERE condition
```

## Example

```sql
FROM method_declaration AS md WHERE "@Deprecated" in md.getAnnotation()
```

### Alias syntax

The alias syntax is used to give a name to the entity. This is useful when the entity is used multiple times in the query. It's mandatory
to use the alias to invoke the entity methods.

```sql
FROM method_declaration AS md WHERE md.<Entity method>
```

Learn more about the entity methods below in the API Index.
