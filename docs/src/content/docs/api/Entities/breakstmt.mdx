### BreakStmt <Badge text="Entity" variant="tip" size="small" />

In Java, the break statement is used within loops (for, while, do-while) and switch statements to immediately terminate the execution of the current loop or switch block and transfer control to the statement following the terminated block.
When encountered, it stops the current iteration and continues with the next one, bypassing any code that comes after the continue statement within the loop body.
This is particularly useful when you want to skip specific iterations based on certain conditions while allowing the loop to continue its normal execution for other cases.

#### Example
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
    break; // BreakStmt
    }
    // Code to be executed for all iterations except when i is 5
}
```
