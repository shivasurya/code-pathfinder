## Operators <Badge text="Condition" variant="tip" size="small" />

Operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value.

| Operators                 |
|---------------------------|
| `&&`                      |
| `\|\|`                      |

## Check Conditions

Check conditions are used to filter out entities based on their attributes. Code-Pathfinder has adopted `expr-lang` as its expression language.
You can use variety of operators to compare two values.

| Checks                    |
|---------------------------|
| `!=` - Not Equals         |
| `==` - Equals             |
| `>`  - Greater than       |
| `<`  - Less than          |
| `in` - In ("uwaterloo" in ["uwaterloo", "mit", "stanford"])    |
| `like`  - "shiva" like "shiv*"          |
